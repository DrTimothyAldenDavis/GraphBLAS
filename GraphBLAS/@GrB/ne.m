function C = ne (A, B)
%A ~= B not equal.
% C = (A ~= B) compares A and B element-by-element.  One or
% both may be scalars.  Otherwise, A and B must have the same size.
%
% See also GrB/lt, GrB/le, GrB/gt, GrB/ge, GrB/eq.

% The pattern of C depends on the type of inputs:
% A scalar, B scalar:  C is scalar.
% A scalar, B matrix:  C is full if A~=0, otherwise C is a subset of B.
% B scalar, A matrix:  C is full if B~=0, otherwise C is a subset of A.
% A matrix, B matrix:  C is sparse, with the pattern of A+B.
% Zeroes are then dropped from C after it is computed.
